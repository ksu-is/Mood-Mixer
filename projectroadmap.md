# Sprint 1:
- [x] Proposed a topic and submitted it for approval.
- [X] Explored a existing Python code base related my topic.
- [x] Joined KSU-IS.
- [x] Forked a repository into KSU-is.
- [x] Updated README.md
- [x] Tested code and made sure it worked.
- [x] Updated projectroadmap.md 

# Sprint 2: Development & Feature Build-Out
- [x] Created `main.py` to handle user interaction and mood input.
- [x] Built `play_playlist.py` module to store mood–playlist mappings and open Spotify links.  
  *(Note: playlist links are placeholder URLs for now and will be updated with finalized playlists later.)*
- [x] Connected `main.py` and `play_playlist.py` so the user input triggers the correct playlist.
- [x] Tested the program end-to-end to ensure playlists open correctly in the browser.
- [x] Added additional mood categories: calm and euphoric.
- [x] Updated the playlist dictionary with actual Spotify playlist links.
- [x] Implemented basic input handling and case normalization (`.strip().lower()`).
- [x] Added feedback messages for invalid mood input.
- [x] Updated README.md to include project setup instructions and usage examples.
- [x] Debugged issues with imports and file naming (`play_music.py` → `play_playlist.py`).
- [x] Updated `projectroadmap.md` to reflect Sprint 2 progress and accomplishments.

# Sprint 3: Final Enhancements & Presentation
- [x] Added more detailed mood descriptions or prompts to improve user experience.
- [x] Refined **user feedback** to make prompts and error messages clearer and more friendly. 
- [x] Added a **random mood feature** that lets the program pick a mood automatically when the user types `random`.
- [x] Implemented a **loop** in `main.py` so the program continues running until the user types `exit`, allowing multiple moods to be explored without restarting.
- [x] Improved error handling and added input validation to prevent crashes.
- [x] Ensured **case normalization and whitespace stripping** (`.strip().lower()`) for robust input handling.
- [x] Finalized Spotify playlist links and verified they open correctly in the browser. 
- [x] Updated README.md with final project description, screenshots, and usage instructions.
- [x] Prepared final project demo and practiced explaining the workflow.
- [x] Completed final review of all files and ensured everything runs smoothly.
- [x] Submitted final project and uploaded all updated files to the KSU-IS repository.
