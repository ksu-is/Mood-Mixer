## 🎵 Mood-Mixer

Mood-Mixer is a Python program that helps users find and play songs that fit how they’re feeling.  
Instead of being a big music app, it’s a small and simple tool that gives song ideas based on your current mood.

### 💡 How It Works

- The program picks songs from a list or music API that match that mood.  
- The goal is to make it easy to find music that fits how you feel without a lot of extra steps.
